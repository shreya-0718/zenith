I made this project to explore more advanced hardware and firmware :)
Also, to get experience with the STM32 and its IDEs.

## Features:
- USB-C 
- MicroSD Card
- Servos: Two PWM Channels
- Sensors: I²C barometer (BMP580) and charger (BQ25883), SPI IMU (ICM-45686)
- Two programmable LEDs

## To Use:
- Install STM32CubeIDE here: https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html
- Use the code in here as a starter, and build from there!
- Use the schematic below as a guide.
